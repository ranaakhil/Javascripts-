// 2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula (you can even implement both versions)

// Steven wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a resturant. In his country, 
// it's usual to tip 15% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 20%.
 
// 1. Your task is to caluclate the tip, depending on the bill value. Create a variable called 'tip' for this. It's not allowed to use an if/else statement ðŸ˜…
//  (If it's easier for you, you can start with an if/else statement, and then try to convert it to a ternary operator!)
// 2. Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example: 'The bill was 275, the tip was 41.25, and the total value 316.25'
 
// TEST DATA: Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
 
// HINT: To calculate 20% of a value, simply multiply it by 20/100 = 0.2
// HINT: Value X is between 50 and 300, if it's >= 50 && <= 300 ðŸ˜‰
 
// GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€


let usualTip = 15;
let extraTip = 20;

let bill = 275;

let tip1 = usualTip/100*bill;
let tip2  = extraTip/100*bill;

if(bill>=50 && bill<=300){
    console.log(tip1);
}else{
    console.log(tip2);
}
let total = bill+tip1; 

console.log(`The bill was ${bill}, the tip was ${tip1}, and the total value ${total}`)
